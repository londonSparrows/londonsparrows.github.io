        The London Sparrows is the oldest wheelchair basketball club in London, and one of the best. Formerly known as the Hackney Sparrows, we train in Hoxton, although our members come from all areas of London and beyond.
        The strength of the Sparrows lies in our diversity: we have men, women, juniors, seniors and welcome both disabled and able-bodied players.
